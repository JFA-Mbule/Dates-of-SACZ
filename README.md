# Dates-of-SACZ
This project aims to provide the dates of SACZ events from 1991 to the present. All the SACZ dates available here are taken from the historical Climate Monitoring and Analysis Bulletin (Climanalysis) of the Weather Forecasting and Climate Studies of the National Research Institute Spaces (CPTEC/INPE). Some dates such as before 1995 were obtained from several studies of SACZ in the annals of Brazilian meteorology conferences, and Ms dissertations of CPTEC/INPE. We make critical works to confirm all dates, confronted it with OLR data, upward movement fields, and satellite images (when is necessary). Dates will be updated at the end of each season of the SACZ events. 

You can see the identifies methods in several studies about SACZ found easily in CPTEC repositories, or e.g. Rosso et al., 2018 (doi:10.3390/atmos9110431).

Note: the dates in GitHub project code are provided on an 'as-is' basis and the user assumes responsibility for its use.
